# Word-Level-Language-Identification-in-English-Telugu-Code-Mixed-Data

In a multilingual or sociolingual configura-
tion Intra-sentential Code Switching (ICS) or
Code Mixing (CM) is frequently observed
nowadays. In the world most of the people
know more than one language. The CM us-
age is especially apparent in social media plat-
forms. Moreover, ICS is particularly signifi-
cant in the context of technology, health and
law where conveying the upcoming develop-
ments are difficult in ones native language.
In applications like dialog systems, machine
translation, semantic parsing, shallow pars-
ing, etc. CM and Code Switching pose seri-
ous challenges. To do any further advance-
ment in code-mixed data, the necessary step
is Language Identification. So, in this pa-
per we present a study of various models -
Nave Bayes Classifier, Random Forest Clas-
sifier, Conditional Random Field (CRF) and
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Language
Identification in English - Telugu Code Mixed
Data. Considering the paucity of resources
in code mixed languages, we proposed CRF
model and HMM model for word level lan-
guage identification. Our best performing sys-
tem is CRF-based with an f1-score of 0.91.
